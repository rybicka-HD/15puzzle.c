# 15puzzle.c
A 15 puzzle implementation in a single file of C99. Should be compilable 
with any C compiler supporting C99 or later or just run `make` in the root
directory of this project. It probably shows some warnings whe compileng with
make, I plan to fix those later.

This was written in one afternoon on my phone. The first commit should contain
the original code along with a readme and a license.

The code is released into public domain. Do whatever the fuck you want
with it.
